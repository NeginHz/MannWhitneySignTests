# Statistical Hypothesis Testing Using Non-Parametric Tests

## Overview
This project explores the implementation of non-parametric statistical tests, focusing on:
1. The Sign Test
2. The Mann-Whitney U Test

The study includes step-by-step guides for conducting these tests and applies the Mann-Whitney U Test to analyze real-life data. Specifically, it investigates age differences between male and female patients in rural areas diagnosed with hypertension and a history of stroke.

## Features
- Explanation of statistical hypothesis testing frameworks.
- In-depth analysis of non-parametric methods.
- Real-world application using Python for data processing and statistical testing.
- Detailed interpretation of results.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** `scipy`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`

## Structure
- **Introduction:** General framework of statistical hypothesis testing.
- **Sign Test:** Theory, methodology, and practical application.
- **Mann-Whitney U Test:** Theory, methodology, and real-life example.
- **Conclusion:** Key takeaways from the study.

## Real-Life Application
Using a subset of the Stroke Prediction Dataset from Kaggle, the study evaluates age differences between demographic groups. The Mann-Whitney U Test was performed with a two-tailed test at a significance level of Î± = 0.05.

## Results
The analysis concludes with no significant age difference between the two groups based on the calculated p-value (0.7178), emphasizing the robustness of non-parametric methods for data analysis.
