**Title:** Statistical Hypothesis Testing Using Non-Parametric Tests

**Description:**

As part of my coursework in inferential statistics, I conducted a detailed case study on *Statistical Hypothesis Testing Using Non-Parametric Tests*. This project focused on:

- Designing and implementing statistical tests (Sign Test and Mann-Whitney U Test) for datasets with non-normal distributions.
- Analyzing real-world data to explore differences in demographic groups (e.g., age comparison of rural patients with specific medical conditions).
- Enhancing my skills in hypothesis testing, result interpretation, and data visualization using Python.

This experience solidified my understanding of statistical concepts and improved my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios. I'm excited to bring these analytical skills to future data-driven roles in AI and beyond.
